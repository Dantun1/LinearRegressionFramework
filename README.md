# Custom Linear Regression Framework 

This is a custom OOP based framework for end-to-end model training/evaluation. I want to implement key ML models in Python without existing ML libraries so I won't be using scikitlearn/TensorFlow etc. 
I plan for it to be extensible so I can add more models later but for now it is just single/multiple linear regression.
